Project repository for DSCI-100

This project is for the course DSCI 100 at UBC 2024 Semester 2.

We Group 17 made a report about **"Classifying Celestial Bodies from Spectral Characteristics"**

In this repository there is a file "Report_Group_17.html" Which is the html file of our final report for performing a classification model based on a dataset we found online.

The process and method of procedures of how we carry out our report could be found in the repository with the file name "Report_Group_17.ipynb"
